**Hilton Chiang** was a senior software engineer (with strong ***Electrical Engineering*** background) specialized in communication and networking at ***Alibaba Inc.***. He is now focused on the research and programming of ***humanoid animation*** in his free time. However nannying kids keeps him occupied for the day.

He loves Chinese poems and working out. He looks shredded even in his middle sixties. 

他的一點人生感悟：
<div className="prose text-2xl max-w-none pb-8 pt-8 dark:prose-invert xl:col-span-2">
> 懸樑刺骨斷深眠，孔孟詩書枉少年， 
>
> 至老方知富貴路，一分人事九分天。
</div>
他的簡單座右銘：

<div className="prose text-2xl max-w-none pb-8 pt-8 dark:prose-invert xl:col-span-2">
> 一生剛克 一世潛沉
</div>
