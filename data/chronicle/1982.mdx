National Chiao Tung University is the school where I went to for my B.S. degree study in Electrical Engineering. I was studying in the Department of Electronic Engineering, I don't know if they changed the Department's name. Most technical schools have only one Electrical Engineer department, however, NCTU divided E.E. into different departments.
