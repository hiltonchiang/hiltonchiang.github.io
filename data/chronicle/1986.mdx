I earned my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), renowned for its <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between"       href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/communication-theory-systems" target="_blank"> Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering <Symbol1f517 /></a> and its pioneering research in communication systems and theory. Several faculty members went on to found <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between" href="https://www.     qualcomm.com/" target="_blank"> Qualcomm Inc. <Symbol1f517 /></a>, launching a successful cellular phone chip business. Although I only spent one year at UCSD, I completed the comprehensive examination and received my master's degree before returning home. Academic research wasn’t my primary passion, and I knew I didn’t want a lifelong career in academia. However, the advanced probability theory I studied there has been invaluable, giving me a stochastic perspective on problem-solving.

UCSD is located in La Jolla, San Diego. <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between" href="https://students.ucsd.edu/well-being/personal-safety/blacksbeach.html"       target="_blank">Black's beach <Symbol1f517 /></a>, though close to campus, is notoriously difficult to access. On my first visit, I was surprised to discover it was a nude beach!
