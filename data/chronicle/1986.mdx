University of California in San Diego is the school where I went to for my M.Sc. degree study in Electrical Engineering. <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between" href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/communication-theory-systems" target="_blank"> Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering <Symbol1f517 /></a>is well known for his core research in communication system and theory. Some of the professors joined <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="_blank"> Qualcomm Inc. <Symbol1f517 /></a> to start up a cellular phone chip business. However, I just spent one year there, I passed the comprehensive examination and got my MS degree before I went back home. Well, academical research was not in my best interest and I did not want to spend all my working life in academia! Nevertheless, the advanced probability theory I learned really helps me to view things empirically and handle things heuristically.

UCSD is located in La Jolla, San Diego. The <a className="inline-flex items-center justiry-between" href="https://students.ucsd.edu/well-being/personal-safety/blacksbeach.html" target="_blank">Black's beach <Symbol1f517 /></a>is not far away from the campus but it's hard to access. The first time I accidentally found it, I was surprised to see a nude beach there.
