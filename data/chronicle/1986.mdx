University of California in San Diego is the school where I went to for my M.S. degree study in Electrical Engineering. Department of EECS (Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) is well known for his core research in spread spectrum communication and others. Some of the professors joined Qualcomm Inc. to start up a cellular phone chip business.
