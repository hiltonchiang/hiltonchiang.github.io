summary: 'A surgery to cure Achalasia problem.'
---

In late 1983, while serving in the Navy, I began experiencing difficulty swallowing. After a series of tests, I was diagnosed with Achalasia in 1985. That same year, I underwent thoracic surgery, which left a prominent 40 cm scar on my left chest—a lasting reminder of that challenging time.

Even today, swallowing remains a daily struggle. I have to drink plenty of water with each meal to help guide food down into my stomach. This condition is lifelong; it’s something I will always have to manage.

Achalasia is extremely rare, affecting only about 1 in 200,000 people. Its true cause remains a mystery—even now, no one knows exactly why it occurs. Somehow, it happened to me.

Despite the difficulties, there’s a silver lining: I eat slowly and consume less, which means I never have to worry about gaining excess weight.
