summary: 'A surgery to cure Achalasia problem.'
---

I got a swallowing problem in late 1983 when I was in the Navy and later diagnosed as Achalasia in 1985. I had a thoracic surgery in May of 1985, and it left a 40 cm scar on my left chest. Even today, I still have to drink a lot of water to push food downward into my stomach while swallowing; it cannot go away, and it will stay for my entire life

It is extremely rare for people to have an Achalasia problem; the chance may be just 1 in 200,000 to occur. The real cause of Achalasia is still not clear. I just got it. The good thing is I eat less and slowly; I do not get fat, obviously
